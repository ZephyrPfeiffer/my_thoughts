<h2>How It's Made:</h2>

<hr>
 
<h3>Tech Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Express, Node, EJS, Mongodb, Mongoose, Passport, and Cloudinary</h3>

<p>Before building this web application, I created mockups for the general layout of the website and figured what type of information I would be storing in the database. Afterwards, I implemented authentication so that each user would only have access to their personal dashboards. Once that was done, I created and implemented the key features that would allow the web application to function properly. Once the key features were working, I created more defined layouts for all webpages and created a theme for all webpages to revolve around. Lastly, I implemented media queries to ensure that the web application was responsive.</p>

<p>While building this application, I learned about the importance of planning all the information that would be needed for the web application to function properly. Information such as what data will be stored in the database gave me a more clear idea of how the web application should be stuructured and where the data should be used in the application. I also learned more about the importance of unit testing and how it can greatly reduce the amount of bugs that occur within a web application.</p> -->
